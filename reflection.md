- What are your initial impressions of Java? 
    This isn't my first time coding in Java (I took AP Computer Science A in high school), so it was nice to get back into the groove of it. Since I'm familiar with Java, the idea-to-code process was much more quick and intuitive to me than it was for Python.

- Can you draw any conclusion about programming in general from the similarities or the differences between the two languages? 
    Java is definitely more finicky with specific syntax, such as curly brackets and semicolons. It's also a lot stricter with its data types (i.e. an array has a static number of slots but you can add and remove from an ArrayList). That being said, the two languages share a lot of the key words and ideas, such as for loops, if statements, calling methods, etc.
    
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
    My initial method for the word mirroring was looping through the input string and using .substring to see if the current character plus a certain number of characters was equal to a word (i.e. "me", "you", "I", etc). This was really inefficient and confusing and kept on creating out of bound errors, so I instead used the String.split() method to split up the string into a String array, which ended up being a lot easier to work with. 

    My advice would be to just write down the code, even if you know it'll be inefficient/"bad code", because you can always go back and edit it.
